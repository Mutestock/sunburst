Edit: People have since then informed me, that nobody is going to open a github link in a job application which makes this project pointless. Archived.

This is literally just a "Look, I'm not incompetent" project. I'd rather be spending my time on something which actually accomplishes something... I'll continue until someone decides I'm competent enough for a job.

I can use cassandra, redis, neo4j, rocksdb and any rdbms as well.

Current the goal is to show experise in: Python, Rust, C#, Typescript, Javascript and maybe Haskell (which I don't know, but would like to learn because I find it interesting). I know Java as well, so that might be a thing I'll add at some point. Depends on how long I have to do this... -_-

The name "sunburst" refers to the MTG mechanic "sunburst". It adds power through multiple colors. Colors are techs here

Note that all passwords are placeholders. They'll be swapped and managed properly with secrets whenever deployment becomes relevant.

Note that I am not suggesting a setup like this is useful. Preferably you'd want to keep your stack simple IRL. This is just for demo purposes.
